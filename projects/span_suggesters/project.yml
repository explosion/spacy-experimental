# Workflows are sequences of commands (see below) executed in order. You can
# run them via "spacy project run [workflow]". If a commands's inputs/outputs
# haven't changed, it won't be re-run.
workflows:
  train:
    - train_spancat
    - evaluate_spancat

# Project commands, specified in a style similar to CI config files (e.g. Azure
# pipelines). The name is the command name that lets you trigger the command
# via "spacy project run [command] [path]". The help message is optional and
# shown when executing "spacy project run [optional command] [path] --help".
